			@description = Due to its distance from Kerbin, it wasn't until fairly recently that Kerbalkind discovered the Kerbol system's most distant planet. At first scientists thought Neidon might be an orange, rocky planet like Duna, but they quickly realized they were in fact looking at an ice giant similar to Urlum.
